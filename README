Building
--------

To build the PDFs for the document, you need a recent TeXLive system with the
following base packages (plus their dependencies):
* ctex, biblatex-caspervector, latexmk.

You also need Chinese fonts.  The fandol package in TeXLive provides some FOSS
Chinese fonts, but the characters "摛" (U+645B) in Section 18 and "囧" (U+56E7)
in Section 21 of the Chinese version are currently missing from the fonts.
Alternatively, you may use another Chinese font supporting a more comprehensive
character set (see `texdoc ctex' for some pre-configured options available).

With the dependencies above, run `latexmk' in this directory to build the PDFs;
to build the English version only, run `latexmk up2020-en'.
