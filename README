Building
--------

To build the PDFs for the document, you need a recent TeXLive system with the
following base packages (plus their dependencies):
* ctex, biblatex-caspervector, latexmk.

You also need Chinese fonts.  The fandol package in TeXLive provides some FOSS
Chinese fonts, but the character "æ‘›" (U+645B) from Section 18 of the Chinese
version is currently missing from the font.  Alternatively, you may use another
Chinese font supporting a more comprehensive character set (see `texdoc ctex'
for some pre-configured options available).

With the dependencies above, run `latexmk' in this directory to build the PDFs.
Alternatively, you can read the pre-built PDFs for tagged releases at
